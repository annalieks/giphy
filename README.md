# Giphy

Giphy is an HTTP server that generates a GIF by the query (i.e. `elephant`).
It caches the generated GIFs so that you can generate them a lot faster. Also, the user history is stored.
You can clear the cache or the history, get the data from both, or reset the cache only for the specific query.
